<div id ='changeMe' style ="text-align:left;">  What's up and welcome. I'm Garrett Cook and am a current Student here at Kennessaw State University.
    I grew up in SouthEast Georgia where I spent most of my teenage years attending school and then later the local college once I've turned 17.
    Attending school,hanging with friends and relatives in the local area was all I did at the period from 2013 until 2019. Once I received my Associates in 2019 I had nothing to do honestly.
    Working in a call center and going home at the end of the day were my only options. At that point I knew I wanted more out of life.So I joined the Airforce.
    From that point until now, joining the USAF with only an Associates Degree and no experience to my name did more for my life than I could have ever imagined.

        Having a degree period increased my pay as a USAF Airman and I got to travel to many states and countries.
    Japan,Guam,California,Texas and Seattle were all awesome.
    I enjoyed my time as a FireMan in the USAF, and it allowed me to meet my better half whom which I got to marry.

        Brief detailed information:
    -I've attended the College of Coastal Georgia in 2013 and have received an Associates of Science in History.
    Following that I volunteered myself to join the United States Air force as a Civil Engineer Fireman in 2019.

        Now come 2023 I see myself back in school striving to become more educated and knowledgeable withing the world of Information Technology.
    This is my third semester at Kennessaw State University, and I've yet to have any problems merging into the community.
    Many students here are extremely friendly and reliable to work with. It is a bit odd to be a bit older, attending school, but the benefits of being knowledgeable in this field are worth it.
    The professors are understandable,reliable and easy to contact as well as advisors and other officials in the assistant organizations on campus.
    It's a wonderful community and the students seem to enjoy it just as much as I do.
        The previous two semesters were a bit rough for me getting back into the educational world ,but I hit the ground running and won't stop.
    Willing to learn and take the time to understand the skill requirements to excel in the IT field.</div>
